# Elearning-Experience-Research

## Overview
This project investigates the factors influencing learners' acceptance and usage of E-learning systems among university students in Ho Chi Minh City. The study integrates the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Task-Technology Fit (TTF) to identify key determinants of E-learning adoption. Using survey data from 374 students, the research applies Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to evaluate how factors such as Self-Efficacy, System Functionality, and Task-Technology Fit affect learners’ Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, and Intention to Use.
The findings emphasize that universities should enhance system quality, invest in digital skills training, and optimize user interface design to improve engagement, motivation, and learning effectiveness in online education.

## Research Objectives
- Identify key factors influencing students’ acceptance and use of E-learning systems.
- Analyze the relationship between Self-Efficacy, System Functionality, TTF, and learners’ adoption behavior.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving the quality and effectiveness of digital learning environments.
